The problem with this is that most languages do not include
arbitrary console I/O in their standard libraries.

I wrote a C version, but this depends on the non-standard conio
library. You can actually compile and run this on a 80286 running
DOS, but a lame 64-bit Windows 7 workstation will work, too ;)
